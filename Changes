    * Added failing tests for loading record links in collections

    * Fixed a bug where collections could not load objects that linked to other

      the tests from passing

      the API in 0.03. This is now fixed. Thanks CPANTS.

    * Added a DustyDB::Object model
    * Complete rewrite of DustyDB::Record and DustyDB::Model
