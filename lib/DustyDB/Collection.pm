=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class encapsulates a collection of records stored in DustyDB.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 model

This is the model that the collection belongs to.

=head2 class_name

This is the class name of the record objects.

=cut

has model => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'DustyDB::Model',
    required => 1,
    handles => [ qw( class_name construct table init_table ) ],
);

=head2 filter_subroutine

Do B<not> use this directly. See L</filter> instead. This contains a reference to the subroutine that is used to filter the records (if any).

=head2 has_filter_subroutine

This is a predicate that returns true if L</filter_subroutine> is set.

=cut

has filter_subroutine => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'CodeRef',
    predicate => 'has_filter_subroutine',
);

=head2 records

This is the list of records that belong to this collection.

=cut

has records => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'ArrayRef',
    lazy => 1,
    auto_deref => 1,
    default => \&_build_records,
);

=head2 iterator_index

Do B<not> use this directly. See L</next> instead. This is the internal pointer into the L</records> array.

=cut

has iterator_index => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => 'Int',
    default => 0,
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 filter

  $collection->filter( %params );
  $collection->filter( $method_name );
  $collection->filter( $code_ref );

Given a description of a filter, this method will filter the records accordingly. There are three kinds of arguments that may be passed:

=over

=item 1.

C<%params>. If you pass a hash of parameters, the keys are expected to be column names in the model object and the vlaues are expected to be values to match. These values may either be a scalar for an exact match or a regular expression to perform a pattern match.

=item 2.

C<$method_name>. If a string is given that matches a method defined on the model object, that method will be called (with no arguments) on every object. Any time a true value is returned by that method, it will be included in the collection.

=item 3.

C<$code_ref>. If a code reference is passed, this code reference is called for each object with C<$_> set to the object being evaluated. If the subroutine returns a true value, the object evaluated will be included in the collection.

# FIXME This implementation goes ahead and grabs all the data up front.  This
# could be a VeryBadThing(tm). That is, if we have a bazillion records and we
# dump every one of them into this array: bad stuff. This is especially bad
# since we pre-construct each of these too. Very Bad.
#
# However, it's easy, which is, in my book, a good thing for 0.01 versions.

sub _build_records {
    my $self = shift;

    # Initialize the table in case it ain't

    # Get ready to read the database

}

=head2 count

  my $count = $collection->count;

Returns the number of records matched by the filter (or number of records total if there is no filter).

=cut

sub count {
    my $self = shift;
    my @records = $self->records;
    return scalar @records;
}

=head2 first

  my $record = $collection->first;

Returns the first record matched or C<undef>.

=cut

sub first {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->count > 0 ? $self->records->[0] : undef;
}

=head2 last

  my $record = $collection->last;

Returns the last record matched or C<undef>.

=cut

sub last {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->count > 0 ? $self->records->[-1] : undef;
}

=head2 next

  my $record = $collection->next;

Returns the next record in the collection. On the first call, it returns the first record. On the second, it returns the second. This continues until it reaches the last record and then it returns C<undef>. This sequence will repeat immediately after returning C<undef> if called again.

=cut

sub next {
    my $self = shift;

    # Get the index
    my $index = $self->iterator_index;
    $self->iterator_index( $index + 1);

    # Get the object
    my $next;
    if (defined $self->records->[ $index ]) {
        $next = $self->records->[ $index ];
    }

    # On undef we need to reset the iterator
    else {
        $self->reset;
    }

    return $next;
}

=head2 reset

  $collection->reset;

Resets the record pointer used by L</next> so that the next call to that method will return the first record.

=cut

sub reset {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->iterator_index(0);
}

sub _hash_to_filter {
    my $self   = shift;
    my %params = @_;
    my $attrs  = $self->class_name->meta->get_attribute_map;

    # First, a sanity check 
    for my $name (keys %params) {

        # Don't filter if we can't filter
        Carp::croak "$name is not an attribute of ", $self->class_name
            unless defined $attrs->{ $name };
    }

    # Second, build the checker routine 
    return sub {
        my $result = 1;
        while (my ($name, $match) = each %params) {

            # TODO It would be lovely to have the smart match operator here, but
            # I want this to work on 5.8 still. Perhaps have this for 5.8, but
            # switch on ~~ if the compiler is 5.10?

            # Handle a regex
            if (ref $match and ref $match eq 'Regexp') {
                $result &&= $_->{$name} =~ /$match/;
            }

            # Handle a number
            elsif ($attrs->{ $name }->type_constraint->is_a_type_of('Num')) {
                $result &&= $_->{$name} == $match;
            }

            # Handle any other scalar
            else {
                $result &&= $_->{$name} eq $match;
            }
        }

        return $result;
    };
}

=head2 contextual

  my @records = $collection->contextual;
  my $iter    = $collection->contextual;

You probably won't need to call this yourself. It basically makes the switch between the array and this collection class.

=cut

sub contextual {
    my $self = shift;
    return wantarray ? $self->records : $self;
}
